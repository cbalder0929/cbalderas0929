It is a universally accepted theory that a foos downness can be measured with a simple mathematical equation. Which is the greater the length of ones tube socks the crazier said individual is. A foo is a term used by members of the Urban Mexican community that originated in California and is shorthand for fool. The sock check became a popular tradition amongst skaters and cholos across California after it was discovered that foos with lowcut socks are in fact not down at all. Having immense levels of downness is extremely important for the survival and well being of our  youth.  This nation was founded by some of the downest foos and a lot of their success can be credited to the length of the socks they wore on a daily basis. There are so many benefits to high rise socks like increased warmth retention, protection against shrubs, thorns bugs and bruising and increased storage capacity.
