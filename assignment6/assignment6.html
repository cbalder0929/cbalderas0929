			Dogs can't have an indoors-only lifestyle; they need a lot of exercise, plenty of walks, and in general, a lot of time spent outdoors to live happy and healthy lives. But if you don't have a yard or access to parks, or have limited mobility, this may present a major challenge. Not only are cats much safer indoors, they're perfectly happy curled up in a sunny spot on the couch or on their very own cat window perch. Simply crack a window for some fresh air (but make sure it's not open wide enough for kitty to escape), and your cat will be totally content watching birds and bugs all day long.

			  I think dogs are the best pets to have. Some people like me need a reason to be active. If it wasn’t for my dog, I would have no reason to go on walks or run but since getting him I know have an obligation to take him out on a daily basis. He is literally forcing me to make better lifestyle choices which will make me healthier and extend my life.

		  <p>I find this information to be false. In my house we have 3 cats and none of them know how to kill mice. I don’t know if they might be broken but they just paw at them and are overall just uninterested in them. My dog however naturally knows how to deal with pest. He makes sure racoons and possums stay out of the yard and on one occasion when someone tried breaking into our backyard my dog handled that man without anyone even having to come outside to investigate.</p>
